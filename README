EvaSys Massmailer
=================

A small Python script for sending emails to all students of ulm university providing them with an individual TAN, intended for invitations to surveys.

Documentation mainly takes place within the scirpts themselves. As the scripts are developed for use at ulm university we wrote it in German.

reminderlist.py:	generate new address list for reminder email.
